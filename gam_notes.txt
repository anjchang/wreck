Niney-

every option is the right thing to do somewhere
but not so wrong elsewhere that you can't ping it there

this is good. but add reuse.

adding wreck stuff-
    an 'option' is built out of smaller things
    zendo-style guess the rule- whether you're "done" specifying an option is unclear
    options are lexical!

Other ideas
    long structured commands
    you can be wrong in multi-step operations, and have to start over (hadean lands! and witness!)
    
    something about pairwise similarity/relational operations used to approximate a global space ???
